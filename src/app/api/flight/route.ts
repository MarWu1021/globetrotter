 *
 * It was 60s, which is the poll period, and the two together meant this cache
 * almost never returned a hit. A random region per request means any one key
 * comes round about every eight minutes; expiring it after one guaranteed it was
 * gone before it was next asked for, so nearly every request missed and every
 * miss is a write. Moving off the Data Cache (see below) changed which meter that
 * billed and not the rate: the free tier's 200k Runtime Cache Writes was 75%
 * spent.
 *
 * Above the revisit interval, writes stop tracking traffic at all and are capped
 * at keys ÷ TTL — eight regions over ten minutes, so ~35k a month however many
 * people show up. The visible liveness survives because the per-visitor seed
 * picks a different aircraft out of the payload each minute regardless; only the
 * positions inside it age, and a ten-minute-old ADS-B snapshot still has
 * everything in it airborne.
